# CDAC-INTELLIGENT-DISTRIBUTED-CONTROL-SYSTEM-FOR-BACKHOE
The objective of the project is to demonstrate the smart control system for the Backhoe by the help of CAN and RTOS so as to control the functioning of the different arms of the Backhoe.
Sir, we checked all the pins of BeagleBone Black nad checked the programs required. 
We took reference from YaqoobEmbedded Youtube channel, and Paul MacWhorter and Tarun Sir's  Project Drive.
